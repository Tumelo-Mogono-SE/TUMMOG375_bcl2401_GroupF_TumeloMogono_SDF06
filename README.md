## **6.15 CodeSpace Pets Instagram Profile Project**

### Overview
For this project, I utilized alot of the grid over the flex, the flex I used mostly if I wanted things in a row to align in a certain way. I used grid for both the profile and gallery div's and that helped alot with the way I wanted the page to resize when changing screens. I also utilized the rem value to size up my stuff to make them resizable based on the root font. This allowed make to make it responsive with out yet adding the media query. At the end I could'nt set a parameter to stop the resizing of the elements when the screen gets to very small sizes.

### Reflections
The project was a hard task for me, many of the ideas I implemented came to me in the last few minutes after intense research. I had to look up alot of things as I couldn't finish all the scrimba task on the layout module. But I am happy with what I achieved to build.
#### Areas of Mastery

- Styling elements
- usage of box model
- layouts using grids 

#### Challenges Faced

-I had trouble adjusting the profile to make the grid reshape the way I wanted it too, I also didn't like the spaceing that occurred after I applied media query.
- Resizing certain elements when shifting from different screen sizes

#### Areas for Improvement

*The hovering effect where the text or small images appear behind an image.
*Advanced layouts 
*Usage of different size values to contribute to responsiveness
*Usage of media query, I had to do alot of research to implement it.

#### Overall Learning Experience
